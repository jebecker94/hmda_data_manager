Example: Download HMDA Data Files
==================================

This example replicates the functionality of the original download_hmda_data.py script
using the new hmda_data_manager package structure. It downloads HMDA files from the
CFPB website and organizes them into appropriate subdirectories.

The script downloads:
- Snapshot datasets (current year data)
- One-year datasets 
- Three-year datasets
- Optionally: Modified LAR (MLAR) files
- Optionally: Historical files (2007-2017)

Files are automatically organized into subdirectories:
- loans/ (LAR files)
- panel/ (panel files)  
- transmissal_series/ (TS files)
- msamd/ (geography files)
- misc/ (other files)

Usage:
    python examples/example_download_hmda_data.py
